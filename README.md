# AI Engineering Course - Week 1: Python Basics
This repo contains my Week 1 exercises for becoming a top-tier AI engineer.

## Files:
- `factorial.py`: Computes factorial with error handling.
- `odd_sum.py`: Generates list 1 to n and sums odd numbers.
- `average.py`: Reads numbers from file and computes average.
- `vowels.py`: Counts vowels in a string.
- `numbers.txt`: Test data for average.py.

Goal: Build foundational Python skills for AI startup prototyping.
