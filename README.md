# AI Engineering Course - Week 1: Python Basics
This repo contains my Week 1 exercises for becoming a top-tier AI engineer.

## Files:
- `factorial.py`: Computes factorial with error handling.
- `odd_sum.py`: Generates list 1 to n and sums odd numbers.
- `average.py`: Reads numbers from file and computes average.
- `vowels.py`: Counts vowels in a string.
- `numbers.txt`: Test data for average.py.

## Week 3: Supervised Learning Basics
- `W3/linear_regression.py`: Predict sepal length (MSE 0.70).
- `W3/setosa_regression.py`: Setosa regression (MSE 0.040).
- `W3/classification.py`: Logistic regression (96.7% test).
- `W3/decision_tree.py`: Decision tree (93.3% test).
- `W3/model_comparison.py`: Model comparison (97.3% CV).
- `W3/mini_project_CV.py`: Logistic production classifier (96.7% test, Versicolor 0.635 issue).
- `W3/DT_mini_project_CV.py`: Decision tree classifier (93.3% test, 100% deployment accuracy).

**Key Insights**: 
- CV (95.3% DT, 97.3% logistic) beats test accuracy.
- Decision trees fix Versicolor with 1.000 confidence.
- Logging and tuning enhance deployment.

Goal: Build foundational Python skills for AI startup prototyping.
